Find My iPhone uses your MobileMe username and password to scrape the Apple MobileMe website in
order to retrieve the location of all your devices (right now they only support iPhone) and return
them to you in JSON format.  This is not a supported API by Apple and could change at any time.

In order to start the software you need Maven 2 installed. Then you can execute:

mvn tomcat:run

This will start a local web server.  Then you can go to the URL:

http://localhost:8080/findmyiphone/

A form will be displayed asking for your username and password.  Submitting them will
execute the API just as if you called it from a programmatic client with the form:

http://localhost:8080/findmyiphone/find?username=...&password=...

This will return a result in JSON format that looks like:

{
   "..deviceid..":
   {"isLocationAvailable":true,"longitude":-122,"accuracy":84.268457,"time":"12:10 PM","isOldLocationResult":true,
   "isRecent":true,"statusString":"locate status available","status":1,"isLocateFinished":false,
   "latitude":37,"date":"July 3, 2009","isAccurate":false},
   ".. another device id..":
   {"noLocation":true,"statusString":"locate status available","status":1}
}

You may need to execute the API several times over a few minutes until it finishes locating the device.
